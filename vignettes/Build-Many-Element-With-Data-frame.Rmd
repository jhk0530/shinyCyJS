title: "Build Many Element With data.frame"
---

If small amount of nodes / edges are needed to be plotted, using `buildNode` and `buildEdge` will fine. However in most case, almost ~ 100 element or more should be plotted.

Which is not efficient with repetitive using of `buildNode` and `buildEdge`.

`buildElem` is function for that case, which build uniform elements(only `node` or only `edge`).


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(shinyCyJS)
```

These 2 code will return same results. (never mind layout, it contains randomness)

```{r}
shinyCyJS(list(
  buildNode("a"),
  buildNode("b", width = 20),
  buildNode("c", width = 30),
  buildNode("d", width = 40),
  buildEdge("a", "b"),
  buildEdge("a", "c"),
  buildEdge("c", "d"),
  buildEdge("b", "d")
))
```


```{r}
a <- data.frame(
  id = c("a", "b", "c", "d"),
  width = c(15, 20, 30, 40)
)

b <- data.frame(
  source = c("a", "a", "c", "b"),
  target = c("b", "c", "d", "d")
)

nodes <- buildElems(a, "Node")
edges <- buildElems(b, "Edge")

shinyCyJS(c(nodes, edges))
```
